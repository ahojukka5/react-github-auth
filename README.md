# react-github-auth

Description of the authentication process using GitHub OAuth.

First one must create an OAuth App on Github. See instructions [here][1]. As a
result, one should have client id, client secret and redirect uri.

Client id and redirect url can be public and client secret should be, like it's
name suggests, secret.
